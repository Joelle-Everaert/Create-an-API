# First API creation 

Creation of an API starting from the base.<br>
<br>
I created a database on Mongodb Compass.
<br>

I worked in MVC architecture.<br>
The model folder contains the configuration of my db and my model for my future posts<br>
The route folder contains my routes to my API data.<br>
I also generated the :<br>
Create<br>
Read<br>
Update<br>
Delete<br>
<br>
I tested all my requests via the Postman application and all are functional.
<br>
There is no front-end. This is just a back-end app with Node.js and Express.js
